Play samples with <= 255 points, <= 65535 points. (count: TBD)
resampling with 3 bit integer + 8 bit fractional counter

usage: >= 3 channels for background music (< 256 points; maybe 1ch for longer samples)
>= 2 channels for game sounds (> 256 points, no resampling needed)

15 samples are enough -> 4 bit for sample selection

there are no effects possible.

a song consists of a number of lines.
each line consists of entries for each channel:
1 bit silence, 4 bit sample number, 3 bit integer increment, 8 bit fractional increment

samplenumber 0: do nothing for this entry (continue a looping sample, play a one-time-sample till end, do not reload anything)
1-15: samples 1-15, begin from start.
sample-points will be played as follows: for each played sample add int-increment to index. for each played sample add frac-increment to frac counter. on frac-cnt-overflow add 1 to index.
so each sample will be played at (15+255/256)x rate to 1/256x rate.
silence bit will stop playing. continuation with sample set to 0 after a silence will continue exactly at stop position!

song info: 
-8 number of channels
-8 line duration (in 50 Hz counts, so 20ms to 2,55s possible)
-16 loop entry: after completion of song repeat at this line
-8 length in number of lines
-followed by <length> lines of 2*<number of channels> bytes.

samples:
4 bit points. Interleaved for 2 different samples in each byte, but completely unrelated.
short samples must be placed in one 256 byte segment, but not neccessarily at the beginning.

sample info:
-16 length (in number of points, so 4-bit-blocks)
-16 pointer to beginning
-8  nibble selection (high/low 4 bit)
-16 loop reentry point (offset from beginning where to start after a complete run)
  -> loop reentry point >= length -> no loop
